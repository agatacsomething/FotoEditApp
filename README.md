FotoEditApp
===========

This is a prototype photo editting app for the IPhone (optimized for the iPhone 6)

The goal of this app is that the user chooses a photograph and when he/she clicks a random filter is applied. 

This project uses OpenCV 2.9.1 which is NOT included in the repository. A Podfile is included to make the adding 
of OpenCV to this project more feasible. 

As of 12/12/2014:
The current set of filters:
1. Gaussian Blur (varying radius)
2. Converting image to grayscale
3. Applying a fisheye effect to the image (varying scale as variable)
4. Applying grey square effect
5. Applying grey stripe effect
6. Adding opencv
